<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project is an Ecommerce Recommendation System. It enables users to register, log in, browse trending products, and receive product recommendations using machine learning algorithms. The system utilizes content-based and collaborative filtering to enhance user experience by suggesting relevant products.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

- Ecommerce users often face information overload, making it challenging to select the most relevant products. 
- The business objective is to improve product discovery and boost sales through personalized recommendations that are accurate and scalable.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>Dataset</h2>

- Source: The notebook reads product data typically originating from sources like Walmart product reviews.
- Key Columns: User ID, Product ID, Product Name, Brand, Category, Description, Tags, Image URL, Rating, Review Count, Price, etc.
- Volume: The dataset contains thousands of products (e.g., sample code references 5000 entries).
- Processing: Missing values are handled for all critical fields; text features are preprocessed for recommendation.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning & Preparation</h2>

- Missing Value Handling: 
   - All numerical and categorical features have missing values imputed with sensible defaults.
   - Deduplication: Duplicates are dropped.
- Feature Engineering: 
   - Long column names are shortened; product descriptions and tags are preprocessed.
- Type Conversion: 
   - Relevant columns cast to numeric or string as needed.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="exploratory-data-analysis-eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

**User–Item Statistics:**
   - Explored metrics like number of users, items, interaction counts, review distributions.

**Popular Items:**
   - Bar charts visualizing top products.

**Ratings Analysis:**
   - Heatmaps of user–item ratings, interaction distribution histograms.

**EDA Plots:**
   - Multiple visualizations for understanding product and user engagement patterns.


---
<h2><a class="anchor" id="research-questions--key-findings"></a>Research Questions & Key Findings</h2>

1. What are the most popular products? (Top-N by review count)
2. What’s the interaction and rating distribution?
3. How do users and products cluster?
**Key Findings:**
   - Clear “long tail” in product popularity.
   - Many sparse user–item interactions (typical for ecommerce).
   - Certain brands or categories dominate in visibility.
**Model validation:**
   - Recommendation algorithms are shown to pick up on strong product similarity and collaborative patterns.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dashboard"></a>Dashboard</h2>

- Trending Products: 
    - Displayed dynamically on the homepage.
- Recommendations Panel:
    - After search, users see a grid of recommended products with images, brands, reviews, and ratings.
- UX Features: 
    - Modals for product detail, signup/in, settings for theme and zoom.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="final-recommendations"></a>Final Recommendations</h2>

- Scale Dataset: Consider more diverse product data for better robustness.
- Enhance Collaborative Filtering: Current method is memory-based; matrix factorization or deep learning models can improve accuracy.
- Deploy Cloud/Production: Use Docker, integrate with managed DB, and deploy on a scalable web server.
- Improve UX: Add filters (by price, category, brand), more intuitive search, and better handling of cold-start problems.
- A/B Test Models: Test different recommendation methods for user engagement and conversion lift.
